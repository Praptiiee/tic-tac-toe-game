Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview
This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using Python and the Pygame library. It provides a two-player mode, where players alternate turns to place their respective markers (circle or cross) on a 3x3 grid. The game detects winning conditions and keeps track of player scores.
Features
-	Interactive graphical user interface.
-	Real-time gameplay with alternating turns.
-	Displays the winner and tracks game statistics.
-	Option to restart the game using the R key.

Requirements
 Hardware
-	Computer with at least 4 GB RAM.
-	Screen resolution of 400x400 pixels or higher.
-	Keyboard and mouse for interaction.
 Software
-	Python 3.8 or later.
-	Pygame library (version 2.0 or later).

Installation
Step 1: Install Python
Download and install Python from the official website: python.org.

Step 2: Install Pygame
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: pip install pygame
Usage
 Running the Game
1.	Save the provided Python code to a file named tic_tac_toe.py.
2.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3.	Run the script using the command: python tic_tac_toe.py.
4.	Enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2 when prompted.

 Controls
-	Mouse Click: Place a marker (circle or cross) in the desired grid square.
-	R Key: Restart the game.
-	Close Button: Exit the game.
How It Works
 Game Logic
-	Players alternate turns, placing their marker in an empty square.
-	The game checks for winning conditions after every move:
-	Three consecutive markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
-	The winner is displayed on the screen, and the score is updated.

 Display
-	A 3x3 grid is drawn using Pygame's drawing functions.
-	Circles and crosses are rendered based on player moves.
-	Player statistics are displayed at the top of the screen.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic game development principles, including graphical rendering, user input handling, and game logic. It is an excellent example for beginners learning Python and Pygame.
